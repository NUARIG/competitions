# Competitions

Competitions is an open source tool to run NIH-style peer review of competitions, pilot projects, and research proposals in a cloud-based consortium-wide single sign-on platform.

This repository contains a re-factored version of the [NITRO-Competitions](https://github.com/NUBIC/nitro-competitions) original code base which is currently running at Northwestern University Clinical and Translational Institute (NUCATS). It is work-progress, and intended primarily to enable a cloud-based implementtion in support of the [CTSA National Center for Data to Health (CD2H)](https://ctsa.ncats.nih.gov/cd2h/) operations.
